###Assignment for Class 5 

- Create a re-enactment or recreation of a work by Joseph Beuys or Lygia Clark. Research about their work and find a piece that inspires you. 
- The piece needs to be presented in 10 minutes or shorter. 
- The piece needs to be a solo work that is participatory.  
- Make a blog posting about your re-enactment by Monday 6pm. You can complete the posting after the class with documentation. However, please send a posting with a plan by Monday for me to prepare to give feedback.
