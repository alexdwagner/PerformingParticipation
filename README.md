# Performing Participation
Class by Taeyoon Choi at NYU ITP, Fall 2015  

Is there a script behind our participation in everyday events? What are the factors that are engineered into human experience? This class will explore the codes of participation embedded in technological spectacle of daily life by staging experimental happenings. Happening, a term coined by a performance artist Allan Kaprow in the 50s, transforms space as an interface for unconventional situations to occur and a site of confrontation and stimulation. Contemporary performance artists create work outside the division of staged and timed events, toward art work that seeks to establish sense of affect and presence. This class will explore participation as an artistic medium to create an unconventional performance art piece. The classes will be split between 40% lecture and 60% student participation through physical activities. 

*Learning outcome:* 

Become confident improvising in unexpected situation. Create series of happenings with instruction and documentation. 

*Objective:* 

Interpret the meaning of participation we perform in daily life, consumption and communication. 

Perform participation in the public sphere, using technology as a medium to build commons between individuals.

#Class 2: September 21 

Reading and response assignment:

Write a short response to the readings, focusing on one of the topics (spectacle, site, ritual, community, institutional structure) on your blog. Please post it online and email me the link by 9.20 Sunday. You might be unfamiliar with many of the art works that Claire Bishop mentions. Please search for them through search engines. [Art 21](http://www.art21.org/) is also a good resource, if you'd like to learn about contemporary art in general. 


Reading:  

- [Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics](http://www.teamgal.com/production/1701/SS04October.pdf) by Claire Bishop
- [Postscript on the Societies of Control](https://cidadeinseguranca.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/deleuze_control.pdf) by Gilles Deleuze
- [Roof is on Fire](http://www.suzannelacy.com/the-oakland-projects/) by Suzanne Lacy 

[Companion](https://github.com/tchoi8/PerformingParticipation/blob/master/companion1.md) to the readings.  


Assignment: Create a list of three movements and three speech, each instruction written in 140 characters or less. For example "crawl around like a crab, jump around to reach the moon, hide behind an object" and "say I'm very hungry very loudly, whisper I love you to someone to your right, call someone and tell them you are thinking about them" You don't need to print them, just bring them in a note to share with the class. We will use these as a material to create short performance pieces.

#Class 6: October 19 


[USER](http://attending.io/events/user) performance 

###Final Letter
  
It was very helpful to meet with many of you on Friday. Since this is such as short class, I think it's a challenge to cover material in depth and give enough feedback. This is something I wrote as part of closing remarks I will share tomorrow. I thought it would be better to share this now, to give you more context for the readings and also tomorrow's event. 

Performing participation, New User. 

There is rarely anything more surprising than finding yourself in the middle of performance art that engage with you, without your acknowledgement. The surprise may come in delight or as a displeasure when you become vulnerable subject of unwanted attention. 

Much like performance art, design has found ‘Participation’ to be an effective approach for creating engaging products. Design as well as the technology industry adopted the term User as a role of person engaging with the product. You might decide to 'check out' from the technological world and leave in peace. However, it’s quiet inconvenient to avoid using technological objects all together. Voluntarily or reluctantly, we perform the role of User in everyday life. User is more than a temporary role one must play to take advantage of a system. It’s also an identity and social class.  

Social media, for example, operates by the voluntary participation of the users. It's a human nature to want to share the joy of private life, express taste and interest and communicate in whatever means possible. Social media amplifies our desire to share. The convenience and instant gratification of ‘Likes’, make it irresistible to resist. However, it’s not a comfortable feeling when the corporations take advantage of my personal data without acknowledgement ([reading](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/media/retailers-use-of-their-fans-photos-draws-scrutiny.html?_r=0)). Much like the performance art that doesn’t ask for permission of participation, the corporations are taking user’s participation. It proves that your participation has a value, your attention to a product, or mediation through a product is valuable to the corporations.  

Don Norman questions ([reading](http://jnd.org/dn.mss/words_matter_talk_about_people_not_customers_not_consumers_not_users.html)) “Artisan? Customer? Consumer? User? Wrangler? Biot? Each of these words is a way to degrade the people for whom we design, a way of labeling them as objects instead of personifying them as real living, breathing people.” I find it painfully ironic that Norman is criticizing the industry and the academic norm of using the word User, since he is responsible for the popularization of “User-centered design”. At any rate, the word User is in the mainstream consciousness and it won't go away for a while. 

There is rarely anything more surprising than finding the museum empty of art works, but some museums are most beautiful without any art in it. Tino Sehgal's exhibtion at Guggenheim Museum was not devoid of art, rather it was full of art work. Other than human bodies in action, engaging with the visitors and telling stories, it was as object-less as possible. ([reading](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/arts/design/01tino.html)) The scripted conversation and improvisational engagement center around the concept of Progress. Where are we progressing now? 

In this class, we've looked at and read about contemporary performance art practices. Art has transformed from material to virtual, political to aesthetic, antagonistic to agreeable (or friendlier), and back again. It's not so much of linear progression, but more like a constant feedback loop of transforming multiplicities. It's not really one trend or style that matters, it's the coexistence of art in different situations. In the end, what matters the most is if we can have a wider perspective for appreciating and 'using' art. The user, in this case, is not the user Don Norman claims that the word has come to mean, the passive, consumer, an anonymous body apt to become complicit to the larger body. The User of art is an active protagonist of the modern world, the one who use technology against the technical determinism, art against the aestheticization of commodity obsessed culture. The use of art is not only the pragmatic use of art work, it's more of an invitation to engage with the world artistically. 'Artistic' is the productive power of the aesthetic imagination, much like how the poetics is the productive power of language. ([reading](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/250614)) Art can be the new weapon (the new weapon Deleuze mentioned in the Postscript for society of Control and did not define) to create sustainable microtopia (maybe a dinner table with Bourriaud and Bishop cheerfully arguing over some hearty soup).
